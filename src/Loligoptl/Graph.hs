-- | Used at the type level to indicate an "open" structure with

-- | Used at the type level to indicate a "closed" structure which
-- supports control transfer only through the use of named
-- labels---no "fallthrough" is permitted.  The number of control-flow
-- edges is unconstrained.
data C

-- | A sequence of nodes.  May be any of four shapes (O/O, O/C, C/O, C/C).
-- Open at the entry means single entry, mutatis mutandis for exit.
-- A closed/closed block is a /basic/ block and can't be extended further.
-- Clients should avoid manipulating blocks and should stick to either nodes
-- or graphs.
