BUILD SYSTEM
------------

In order to build, we're using the cabal build system;
you should have the latest version of the Haskell platform installed.

cabal configure
cabal build
cabal install

will install the project binaries into ~/.cabal/bin.

BINARIES
--------

scanner       -- utilize as 'scanner x', where x is the file you'd like to scan. outputs to stdout and inputfile.out
scanner-repl  -- utilize as in interactive REPL, to view the scanning of tokens in real-time
parser        -- utilize as 'parser x', where x is the file you'd like to parse. outputs to stdout and inputfile.out
grapher       -- utilize as 'grapher x', where x is the file you'd like to scan, parse and graph the resulting AST. requires the graphviz binary 'dot' installed on your system, (assuming it's on your PATH, else grapher fails) and outputs a 'outputfile.out.png', as the visuazlization of the AST.
checker       -- utilize as 'checker x', where x is the file you'd like to scan, parse and check for semantic errors.

TODO
----
- monadic interleaving of state for error recovery in scanner and parser.
- multiple error reporting for parser.
